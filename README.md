It is a mini app that imitates an ordering process. We can add items to the shopping cart then remove them if we want to.
In the "your order" field we can see the entire list and the prices. 

When we click the complete order button modal window pops up where we can enter our card details.
During this time we can not add more items to the shopping cart or remove them.
After we entered our data the purchase is finished and we just have to wait for the food:)
